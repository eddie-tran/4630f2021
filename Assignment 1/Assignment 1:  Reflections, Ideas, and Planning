1. House app
An app that make house buying as easy as can be.
Searching for a house can be time consuming.
Some sites may include listings that the others may not.
The idea is to manage multiple APIs in order to see all listings in the same app.
To implement an like option to be saved into a folder. 
The folder may be access with all the information related to each listing.
If desired, there will be an option to go to the listing's site for more information.

2. Free app
I believe this app should be free.
The developers compensation should come from premium options.
The options are offered to agents and management companies.
It has yet to be decided for what these options include.

3. SNKRS app.
I find it to have a good UI because it is appealing.
The way the app displays shoes, how simple the app is, and the ease of use.
Everything is self explanatory.
When clicking on a product that we like, we will get all the information needed.

4. Yes it has.
The little things that my classmates included in their apps made a difference.
They shortened the steps to achieve their goal played a huge part of this idea.
Hopefully this app shortens the overall time to achieve to goal of finding a new home.
